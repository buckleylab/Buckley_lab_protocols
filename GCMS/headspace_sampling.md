## Microcosm headspace Sampling

* The goal is to measure 12C-CO<sub>2</sub> and 13C-CO<sub>2</sub> 
in the microcosms to determine respiration rates of all C and just 13C.

### Materials:

1. 2 mL gas vials (pre-crimped with grey butyl stoppers) 
  * Enough for all standards and microcosms (+ and 'air' control)
1. 7 (or 8) of the 10 mL gas vials (pre-crimped with blue butyl rubber stoppers)
  * 8 vials needed if using the 8th (largest standard)
1. 0.5 mL and 10 mL gas tight syringes (with the green-red stop cock)
1. He gas tank at gassing station
1. Gas standard tanks
1. Microcosms

* __Note:__ ~10 ml vials actually have an internal volume of ~11.6 ml (crimped with
shallow septa).


### Standards

* Using 10 ml vials to make CO2 mixtures
* ml CO2 gas standard in each vial:
	* Tank (%CO2) : volume (ml)
	1. NA : 0
	1. 1% : 1
	1. 1% : 2
	1. 1% : 4
	1. 5% : 2
	1. 5% : 4
	1. 5% : 8
	1. 100% : 1  (only if respiration rates are high)


### Methods:

#### Flushing vials:

1. Label, seal, and crimp all needed 2 ml and ~10 ml vials.
	* CO2 standard vial labeling: 
		* "X% CO2"  "x mL"
	* Microsom vial labeling:
		* Microcosm\_ID
1. All valves at the gassing station should initially be closed.
1. Turn on He tank (tank valve).
	* The PSI should be low (8-10 PSI) in order to not overpressurize the vials.
1. Stick a needle into each leur lock in the gassing manifolds.
	* Plug up any leur locks that will not be used.
	* Each manifold can be shut off using the valve just upstream.
1. Check to make sure gas is flowing out of each needle and each needle is tightened
fully.
1. Place safey shield between you and vials.
1. Turn on venturi vacuum (at the sink).
1. For a cycle of vacuuming and gassing:
	* __NOTE:__ Make sure the vacuum and gas valves are not open simultaneously.
	  The He gas will just be vacuumed out.
	* Open the valve for the vacuum.
	* Vacuum for: 8 sec (if 2 ml vials) or 20 sec (if 10 ml vials)
	* Close vacuum valve.
	* Open gas valve.
	* Gas for: 8 sec (if 2 ml vials) or 20 sec (if 10 ml vials)
	* Repeat vacuum-gas cycle for 4 times.
		* Each vial should then contain >99.9% He.
    * Remove the vials while the He gas is still flowing.
1. Repeat the entire process until all vials are flushed and filled with He.
1. Turn off He tank, purge the lines, and turn off the venturi vacuum.

#### Making standards:

* Use the gas standard tanks (to left in gassing station, on a ring stand).
* Use 10 mL stopcock gastight syringe to make the stds. 
1. Turn the tank valve counter clockwise to open it. 
	* The tank regulator should show an increase in pressure.
1. Pre-evacuate std vials to volume that you plan on filling 
	* eg., remove 1 ml from vial if adding 1 ml CO<sub>2</sub> gas mixture
1. Insert syringe into regulator through sampling port, fill beyond your
desired volume, press in red button and pull out.
1. __VERY FAST:__ open stop cock and push the syringe plunger to your desired volume. 
	* This allows the gas to come to 1 atm, which is very important for
	  knowing exactly how much gas is in each std.
1. Add gas volume to pre-evacuated 10 ml vial.
1. Inject 250 uL of each of the stds (from the 10 mL vials) into the 2 mL vials. 


#### Headspace sampling of microcosms:

1. Use 0.5 mL gas tight syringe (with stopcock).
1. Push needle through 18 gauge sampling port in the microcosm stopper and visually check
   to make sure the needle is all the way through the stopper (the needle openning must be
   all the way into the microcosm). 
1. Pump the plunger 5 times to mix the headspace gas.
1. Pull plunger up to __0.25 mL__ and push the red side of the stop cock to shut it.
1. Pull syringe out of sampling port and puncture into respective 2 mL vial.
	* __IMPORTANT:__ CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE VIAL YOU'RE SAMPLING INTO MATCHES THE
	FLASK YOU SAMPLED FROM!
1. Repeat for all microcosms (flasks).
1. __IMPORTANT:__ Note what time you finished sampling. 
    * This is very important because data is based on hourly rates. 
	* The sampling is for nothing if we don't know how much time has passed.
1. Air out *all* flasks. For each flask: 
	* Unstopper and flush for 10 sec with filtered air.
		* __IMPORTANT:__ Make sure the air has a very slow flow. We wouldn't want to blow
	the soil out of the flasks!
		* __MAKE SURE:__ to time the 10 sec and keep it consistent between microcosms.
	* Re-stopper the flask.
		* __MAKE SURE:__ the stopper is pushed in airtight.
	* _Don't forget the flasks that don't have gas sampling ports._
	* __IMPORTANT:__ Make sure all stoppers are pushed in airtight.
1. Take a sample of air with the syringe (250 uL) and inject it into the "air" 2 mL vial.
1. __MAKE SURE:__ to note the time you ended flushing the flasks because this will serve
as the starting time for the next gas sampling.
