========================

This protocol outlines a general method for taking soil samples in the field using a corer.

# Materials
1. soil corer(s)
2. metal spatulas marked at desired sampling depth (tape works best)
3. tube-cleaning brushes
4. DI water in spray bottle(s)
5. 70% ethanol in spray bottle(s)
7. 70% ethanol and DI water in large jugs (for refilling)
8. paper towels (can be sterilized by wrapping in foil and autoclaving)
9. gloves
10. labelled bags, sterile and non-sterile
11. cooler with ice or dry ice, depending on needs
12. garbage bags
13. pen and notebook
14. Optional: GPS

# Protocol

Note: Wear gloves throughout

1. Sterilize all tools that will come into contact with the soil using 70% ethanol and paper towels 
4. Take a soil core:
    * Clear the soil surface of debris (unless you want to sample that as well)
    * Press the corer into the soil perpendicular to the surface using slow, even pressure, twisting as you push to prevent compaction
    * If you hit a big rock or barrier, discard and start over
    * Push deeper than your desired sampling depth
6. Use the marked spatula as a ruler and scoop to discard soil deeper than your desired sampling depth
6. Place core into appropriate labelled bag (non-sterile for soil biogeochemical measurements, sterile for soil microbiome measurements)
7. (Recommended) Mix the soil by massaging with your hands through the bag
8. Place sample on dry ice ASAP if it will be used for DNA extraction, on ice if it will be used for microcosms or biogeochemical measurement samples
9. (Recommended) Write down GPS coordinates of sampling location
10. Rinse and clean the corer and spatula using DI water, tube brush, and paper towels. Remove all visible soil
11. Repeat from step 1 until all soil samples are collected
12. Place samples stored on dry ice in a -20 or -80C freezer once you return to lab, samples for soil biogeochemical measurements can be stored at 4C, soil for microcosms should be stored as appropriate based on your experimental design
12 You will want to sieve soils to be used for microcosms or biogeochemical measurements. Typically 4 mm is appropriate for microcosm soil, 2 mm for soil biogeochemical measurements. Make sure you sterilize the sieve and materials between samples for microcosms using 70% ethanol.

Optional step:
* Between core samples, you can take a "dummy" core next to the next sampling site and discard it before taking the real sample. This is supposed to help prevent cross-contamination between sampling sites. I'm not sure if it actually makes a difference.

# Tips
* Always bring more supplies than you think you'll need, including an extra spray bottle in case one breaks
* Bringing an extra corer can speed things up; as one dries from the ethanol, you can use the other to take the next sample
* Bring a helper (or two)
* Avoid ticks
  * Wear light-colored, long sleaves and pants
  * Tuck your pants into your socks and your shirt into your pants
  * Check arms and legs frequently
  * Do a thorough body check at home later 
* Don't forget to bring food, water, and sunscreen if you'll be out all day
* Don't leave garbage at the sampling site, clean up after yourself
