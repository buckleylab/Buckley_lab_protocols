## Purpose 

This test measures the proportions of sand, silt and clay of soil samples. Soil texture has a strong effect on water flow and plant
growth. It is a standard measurement in soil studies.


## Materials

* Dried soils (NOT ground)
* Soil Flocculating Reagent
* Texture Dispersing Reagent
* Measurement tubes (3 total)
* 1 mL pipette
* Stopwatch


## Procedure
1. Add soil to tube "A" until it reaches 15 mL mark.
    * Try to reduce air pockets within the soil by gently tapping the tube.
1. Add 1 mL of texture dispersing reagent to tube.
1. Dilute mixture to 45 mL mark.
1. Shake tube gently for 2 mins.
    * Mixture should be well homogenized. 
1. Let mixture settle for EXACTLY 30 **sec**.
1. Decant supernatant into tube "B".
    * Make sure not to allow settled sand to transfer.
    * Keep tube "A" for measurements.
1. Let mixture settle for EXACTLY 30 **min**.
1. Decant supernatant into tube "C".
    * Make sure not to allow settled silt to transfer.
    * Keep tube "B" for measurements.
1. Add 1 mL soil flocculation reagent to tube "C".
1. Shake tube gently for 1 min.
1. Let mixture settle for around 24 hrs or untill clay suspension settles.
1. Measure volume of sand in tube "A" (Vol_Sand) and silt in tube "B" (Vol_Silt).


## Calculations

Total_volume_soil is 15 mL because you initally added soil to this point. (NOTE: If your soil is not clumpy this should be an ok assuption,
however, ours is rather clumpy and therefor there could be significant airpockets.  Consider using alteration below in "ALTERNATIVE MEASUREMENT").

Vol_Clay = 15ml - (Vol_Sand + Vol_Silt)

%_Sand = (Vol_Sand / 15mL) * 100%

%_Silt = (Vol_Silt / 15mL) * 100%

%_Clay = (Vol_Clay / 15mL) * 100%

Report percentages. 

Additionally, you can report the soil texture based off of the percentages.
To determine soil texture, use the soil texture triangle and/or calculator found at the [USDA-NRCS](http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/?cid=nrcs142p2_054167) website.


## Cleaning

Once all measurements are taken, clean out tubes with water.  Be sure to remove all soil particles.  Dry tubes before next use.


## ALTERNATVE MEASUREMENT
This protocol does not directly measure volume of clay because it forms a gel-like precipitate which expands. This is not ideal because
the total volume is taken to be the inital 15 mL of soil you add to tube "A" that may be affected by air pockets (and soil clumpyness).
As an alternative, you could directly measure the volume of the clay and calculate total volume by adding up the different fractions.

For this method, carefully aspirate supernatent in tube "C" once clay has settled, then dry the tube in drying oven and measure the dry volume of clay (Vol_Clay).

If following this alteration, calculations are as follows:

Total_soil_volume = Vol_Sand + Vol_Silt + Vol_Clay

%_Sand = (Vol_Sand / Total_soil_volume) * 100%

%_Silt = (Vol_Silt / Total_soil_volume) * 100%

%_Clay = (Vol_Clay / Total_soil_volume) * 100%
