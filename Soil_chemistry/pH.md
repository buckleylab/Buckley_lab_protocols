# Application and Principle

>A common method of measuring soil pH is performed by placing a glass
electrode in a mixture of soil and deionized water. Various modifications exist
for determining soil pH.  The most common ratio used for soil-water pH is
1:1 soil:water.  Some laboratories measure pH in a 1:2 ratio of soil to
deionized to improve the fluidity of the slurry; particularly for soils
with high organic matter and clay concentrations that can absorb a
significant volume of water.  Electrolyte solutions, such as 0.01 M CaCl2
or 1 M KCl, can be added to soil rather than deionized water with the
resultant pH referred to as salt pH.  Use of electrolyte solutions avoids
variable soil-water pH due to varying background salt levels in different
soils and improves electrical conductivity in the electrical circuit for pH
measurement (Miller and Kissel, 2010).  Soil pH measurement in deionized
water or 0.01 M CaCl2 in 1:1 and 1:2 soil:solution ratios are official
methods adopted by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (Kalra,
1995).  

__NOTE:__ This protocol uses the 1:1 soil:water method


# Equipment and Reagents

1. pH meter
1. standardization buffers
	* pH 4
	* pH 7	
	* pH 10
1. analytical balance 
1. clean glass 20 mL scintillation vial
1. clean glass rods for stirring the slurry
1. dried soil
1. deionized water
1. a lab notebook for recording values


# Procedure

1. Measure out 5.0 g of dried soil into labled vial.

1. Dispense a volume of DI water equal to the soil weight.
	* 1 mL water = 1 g water 

1. Stir the soil and solution vigorously to completely homogenize the slurry

1. Allow the slurry to sit for 30 minutes.
	* Multiple slurrys can be made in this 30 minute period if needed.

1. __While you are waiting:__ Calibrate the pH meter!
	* Perform at least a 2-point callibration with the pH 4 and 7 buffers.
	* It wouldn't hurt to do a 3-point callibration with the pH 4, 7, and 10 buffers.
	* Rinse the electrode thoroughly with DI water.
	* This can be done before making slurry.

1. Ensure room temperature is between 20 and 25<sup>o</sup>C before proceeding with pH
measurement.

1. Place electrode in the soil slurry and measure pH.  
	* Measurements may be taken with or without continuous stirring.  
	  If measurement is made without continuous stirring, stir the sample
	  with a stir bar before placing electrode in the sample. 
	* Allow adequate time for pH to reach a stable reading. 

1. Record the pH measurement.

1. Rinse the electrode thoroughly with DI water.
	* Electrode can be stored in beaker of water with stirring in between soil samples. 


# Analytical Performance

## Range and Sensitivity

1.	Soil-water pH is most often within a range from 4 to 8.

## Precision and Accuracy

1.	pH measurements can be made to the nearest 0.1 or 0.01 pH unit.  There is
no need to measure pH with more than 2 decimal places since this level of
accuracy is not achievable or required.  If measurements are made to the nearest
0.01 pH unit, pH can be rounded to 0.1 pH units before reporting to clients.

## Interferences

1. Differences in pH will occur with electrode placed in a soil-slurry or in
the supernatant after the soil has settled.  The differences are more pronounced
with soil pH in water compared to electrolyte solutions.  To avoid this
variability in pH, it is important to stir the soil slurry right before
measurement.  With sandy soils, the settling time of soil particles is rapid and
continuous stirring during measurement is recommended.

2. Glass electrodes have a short life span when measuring pH of sandy soils. 
The sand particles are abrasive to the glass resulting in electrode breakage or
malfunction.  When electrodes fail to measure pH of calibration buffers or
quality control samples show more error than expected, replace electrodes.

## Effects of Storage

1. Air-dried soils may be stored several months without affecting the soil pH
measurement provided they are stored in an ammonia free environment or in a
tightly sealed container.

2. The electrodes used for pH measurement should be maintained and stored
according to the manufacturer's instructions. 


## Safety and disposal

1. Autoclave the soil slurry before disposal.
