# Application and Principle

This test measures the total carbon and total nitrogen content in the soil samples.

# Equipment and Reagents

1. LECO machine (LECO TruMac Model 630-300-400)
2. Ceramic boats
3. Analytical scale
4. Soil samples
      * Must be seived and dried.
      * May be ground.
      * If soil clumps are too big, grind a small amount of soil in morter and pestle.
5. Soil standard (On shelf next to LECO)
6. EDTA standard (On shelf next to LECO)

# Procedure

1. Set up computer.
    * Most likely, spreadsheet will already be set up with previous runs above the empty cells that you will use.
    * Below previous runs enter in sample types/IDs, and carousel positions in proper columns.
        * 4 blanks
        * 3 EDTA standards
        * 1 soil standard to start and then another every 15-20 samples.
    * Carousel runs bottom to top and clockwise from 1-10.
    * Put a pause command at first blank and after EDTA standards.

2. Blanks
    1. Place 4 empty boats in first 4 carousel positions (corresponding to the positions of the blanks).
    2. Enter mass as 1.0000g for each blank.

3. EDTA standards.
    1. Tare boat.
    2. Weigh out 0.15±0.005g EDTA into boat.
    3. Select cell corresponding to EDTA sample mass and press right-most button on scale. Mass should be inputed into cell. 
    4. Repeat for each EDTA sample.

4. Soil samples (standards and unknowns)
    1. Tare boat.
    2. Weigh out 0.40±0.005g soil into boat.
    3. Select cell corresponding to soil sample mass and press right-most button on scale. Mass should be inputed into cell. 
    4. Repeat for each soil sample.

5. Start run (Tech in lab should do this)

# Report

Data will come as an excel spreadsheet containing % carbon, % nitrogen, total carbon, total nitrogen, and other information.
Report the carbon nitrogen ratio.
