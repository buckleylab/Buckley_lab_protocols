Gel extraction protocol
=======================

## Authorship

Chantal Koechli, and Nick Youngblut (2011-2014)

## Updates

Cassandra Wattenburger (2018)
* changed dye concentrations (too low before)

## Printing this protocol

See **Printing protocols** in the [README](../README.md#printing-protocols-conversion-of-protocols-to-pdf)

## Notes

* The protocol uses the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega) with
some modifications


## Gel

* 1.5% low melt agarose gel with SybrSafe
* ~35V for 1-1.5 hrs


## Gel clean-up kit modifications

* __5.A., Step 3:__ flow melted gel through the column twice

* __5.A., Step 6:__ flow water through twice


## Method in detail

1. Use the speed-vac to evaporate the compiled pool of samples from each
Sequal plate purification to 100 uL (96 compiled samples per tube). 
	* The volumes can be divided among more tubed to decrease speed-vac time.

1. While speed-vac is running, prepare a 1.5% low melt (or normal) agarose gel, with
SybrSafe. 
	* Make 75 mL of agarose solution
		* Large volume needed to cast a gel with deep wells. 
	* 1.12 g of low melt agarose
	* 7.5 ul of SyberSafe

1. Add 20 uL of 6x loading dye to each concentrated 100 uL sample and mix well.

1. Load 55 uL of the sample into an individual well until all the sample is loaded. 
	* Use 7.5 ul of 100 bp ladder in the 1st lane (+1.5 ul of 6X loading dye).

1. Run the gel at ~35 volts for ~1.5 hours. 
	* It is OK to run the gel at a higher voltage (~70) for a shorter time frame.

1. Pre-weight 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes (1 per sample).

1. Visualize the gel using the UV transilluminator in Room 712
	* (make sure to wear face shield!).
	* Cut out 400-600 bp bands from each lane. 
	
1. Put the cut bands into pre-weighted 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes and weight to find
final weight of gel.

1. Use the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System kit protocol to elute DNA
from gel slices. 
	* Protocol modifications include:
		* running binding solution (w. molten gel) through the column twice
			* increases binding of DNA to column
		* running eluted DNA through column twice in order 
			* increases DNA eluted off the column.
