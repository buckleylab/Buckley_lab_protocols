## Description
How to run a gel for visualizing PCR amplicons.
Note: This is NOT the protocol you should use for extracting sequencing libraries. See [this protocol](./gel_extraction) instead.

## Materials

* Gloves (wear them)
* Molecular-grade agarose powder
* Tabletop scale and weighing supplies
* 0.5x TAE
* Graduated cylinder
* 125 or 500 ml flask
* SYBR Safe gel stain
* Pipette and tips
* Gel loading dye
* DNA ladder
* PCR amplified DNA samples

## Method
1. Put agarose and 0.5x TAE into flask to achieve desired gel viscosity using the scale and graduated cylinder to measure, respectively.
    * 1% agarose is fine for 16S V4 and ITS1 amplicons
    * A higher % agarose is better for smaller amplicon sizes
    * 50 mL is perfect for the smallest gel-box size, 100 mL 
2. Swirl the contents to evenly suspend the agar in solution and microwave for 30 seconds.
    * Make sure it doesn’t boil over
3.	Take flask out (careful hot!) and swirl gently. Microwave for another 15-20 seconds until agarose is completely dissolved.
4.	Allow the solution to cool for 5-10 minutes, until you can hold the bottom of the flask to your palm for several seconds without it hurting.
5.	Add SYBR Safe gel stain to the agar solution to a final concentration of 1x using the pipette and tips.
    * The SYBR Safe is concentrated to 10,000x, so 5 uL in 50 mL will yield 1x 
6.	Swirl the flask gently until the SYBR Safe is evenly distributed.
7.	Place one of the gel cradles with a rubber seal into the gel dock, so that it creates a sealed mold for the gel to firm up in. Don’t forget to add the well comb(s).
    * It helps to keep the rubber seals in place by taping them to the sides of the cradle.
8.	Pour the agar solution into the mold and cover with foil to protect the SYBR Safe from light exposure. Allow to firm up for at least 20 minutes.
9.	Remove the comb and transfer the gel and cradle to an electrophoresis box filled with 0.5x TAE.
    * Alternatively, the gel can be stored in a sealed container at 4°C for up to a day
10.	 Pipette gel loading dye into each PCR reaction or ladder to the appropriate concentration. Load into each well.
    * I like to pipette 1 uL of loading dye onto parafilm and then add 5 uL of sample and mix via pipetting
    * 100 bp ladder is best if doing electrophoresis on 16S V4 or ITS1 amplicons
11.	Once loaded, close the lid and connect the electrodes so that the positive charge is at the end of the gel (where you want the DNA to travel) and the negative charge is at the top (closest to the wells and DNA).
    * DNA has a negatively charged backbone and will travel towards the positive charge. Don’t arrange the charge backwards or you’ll lose your sample!
12.	Connect the electrodes into the power supply (get the charges right). Turn on the power and set to the desired voltage, then run the gel.
    * 150V for 25-30 minutes is sufficient for 16S V4 region amplicons to travel ¾ of the way down the gel in a 1% agarose gel in 0.5x TAE
    * For better separation, lower the voltage and run the gel longer
13.	Use a UV box or lamp to visualize your bands. Take a picture for posterity (and your lab notebook)!
14.	Gels made using SYBR Safe are OK to throw away in the trash.
