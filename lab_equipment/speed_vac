## Printing this protocol

See **Printing protocols** in the [README](../README.md#printing-protocols-conversion-of-protocols-to-pdf)

## Helpful hints

* To speed up the evaporation process (eg., if >=0.5 ml of sample), subdivide your sample(s) into multiple
2 mL tubes and then recombine them once they have all concentrated down to ~50-100 ul.

* Use pre-weighed tubes (weighed prior to adding sample) to quickly and accurately determine the sample
volume as you repeatedly check on your samples during the evaporation process. With this method, you can
easily evaporate samples to within a few ul of the desired volume.
	* TE buffer can usually be used to bring the volume back up to the desired volume if evaporation
	has continued beyond that volume.


## Method

1. Turn on the main power.
1. If heat is desired, set the proper temperature.
1. Hold down __Start__ and __Stop__ keys simultaneously to begin warming up the pump.
	* Allow 10 minutes for the pump to warm up.
	* When done warming up, press __Stop__.
1. Toggle to the desired function by pressing and holding the __Brake__ and __Set Temp__
keys simulantaneously.
	* __Function 1:__ for EtOH precipitation
	* __Function 2:__ for high vapor pressure solvents
	* __Function 3:__ for aqueous solutions
	* __Note:__ On start-up, the device defaults to Function 1.
		
**Indicators of which function is selected:**

1. Hit __Start__ to begin the run.
	* Check samples every ~10-15 min to make sure they are concentrating properly
1. Hit __Stop__ to end the run.
1. Remove samples
1. Hold down __Start__ and __Stop__ keys to restart the vacuum pump.
1. Hold down the __Start__ key for __5 seconds__ to purge moisture/solvents from
the vacuum pump.
1. When done, hit the __Stop__ key to shut off the pump.
1. Turn the main power off.

__WARNING: Since this device does not currently contain a cooling trap, this unit
should not be used with the following materials:__

* Poisonous, corrosive, caustic, or hazardous liquids
* Pathogenic bacteria
* Phenol, Chloroform, or Formamide

__Note:__ This unit spins at 1,200 rpm.
