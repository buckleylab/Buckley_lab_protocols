## Printing this protocol

See **Printing protocols** in the [README](../README.md#printing-protocols-conversion-of-protocols-to-pdf)


## Autoclaved

* Autoclaved trash can be placed in the large trash can near the autoclaves, in the bag they were autoclaved in
* When can is full, put the accumulated autoclaved garbage in a box and take to the Bradfield loading docks disposal area (G???)
* Grab an empty box from the loading dock on your way back up to be used next time

## Sharps

* Seal sharps container and autoclave before disposal
* ??????????????

## Hazardous waste

* Store in fume hood
* When ready to dispose, place liquid waste containers in a Hazardous materials shopping DOT box, with individually filled-out waste [disposal slips](https://sp.ehs.cornell.edu/lab-research-safety/waste/chemical-waste/Documents/2018_HazWasteTipSheet.pdf) for each container
  * If the contents of the container are unknown, fill out [this form](https://sp.ehs.cornell.edu/lab-research-safety/waste/chemical-waste/Documents/HW_Unknown_Chemical_Waste_Form.pdf) instead
* Solid waste should be put in sealable bag with harazardous waste slip attached to the outside (there are large, ULINE resealable bags bought for this purpose next to the fume hood in the GC room)
* Request an [EH&S pickup](https://sp.ehs.cornell.edu/lab-research-safety/waste/waste-pickups/Pages/default.aspx) for the waste

## Other trash tips

* Serological pipettes should not be put in the normal trash, instead they must be placed in a box or non-piercable container and disposed on in the Bradfield loading dock disposal room
  * There is a large box for this near the door that we aren't supposed to block
