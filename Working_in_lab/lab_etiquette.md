***

* __Before you leave at the end of the day__, walk around the lab to make sure that
equipment is shut off and clean, and that shared work spaces that you have used 
have been cleaned up. If you are the last to leave, make sure that the lights are off
and the doors are shut and locked.

* Tip/serological pipet waste goes into tip waste box.

* Once tip waste is full, tape the box shut and bring it down to the dumpster in
the basement.

* Empty tip boxes are disposed of in the trash, unless they are reusable (P-10
white unfiltered tip boxes or P-200 yellow unfiltered tip boxes). Reusable boxes
are placed in the box near the 2nd fume hood.

* Both needles and syringes are to be placed in the sharps containers.

* If you have borrowed equipment, make sure to return it.

* If you notice that the lab is running low on a reagent/product, please write
this information on the white board by the chemical shelf. Please included:
	* product name
	* product number for ordering
	* quantity needed to be ordered

* Autoclave culture waste.

* After autoclaving, rinse out autoclave bins.

* Label freezer boxes with at least: 
	* project/sample name 
	* your netID

* Dispose of phenol/chloroform in the appropriate waste container (chemical jug
in the fume hood). If the container is getting full, notify Chantal (cnk29).

* Use the sign-up sheets to block off time for using lab equipment.

* Make sure the equipment is shut off and clean when it is done being used for the day.

* A designated undergrad will do the dishes and autoclaving unless they are not available.
