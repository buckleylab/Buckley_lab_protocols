# Notes
If you've been using the robot extensively, please do a round of trough cleaning to replace the one's you've used. Thanks!

# Protocol

* Soak the troughs in 10% bleach solution for 20 minutes
* Rinse each trough 3x in distilled water
* Replace the troughs in the pipette tip boxes
  * Make sure to re-insert any dividing tabs that fall out of the troughs
* Remove the box lids and place the boxes face down on the top rack of the dishwasher
* Operating the dishwasher:
  * Check the bottom drawer to make sure the detergent hasn't run out
  * Press the power button
  * Press start until the run starts
  * Note: you have to pull really hard on the door to open the dishwasher after the run is done
 * Put the lids back on the cleaned trough boxes and tape shut with autoclave tape
 * Autoclave the boxes for 30 minutes on a gravity cycle
 * Dry the boxes in the drying oven next to the autoclave at 50C overnight
