# Cellulose Production

1. Plate *Gluconoacetobacter xylinus* glycerol stock onto Herstin and Schram agar plates. 
	* Incubation temp: 30<sup>o</sup>C 
	* Colonies should form within ~7 days
	* Only a few plates of media should be needed.
	* The rich media is used to get a healthy stock which is needed to grow well on the
  minimal Heo and Son media
2. Streak *Gluconoacetobacter xylinus* from single colonies grown on the Herstin 
and Schram media to Heo and Son 0.5% glucose agar plates. 
	* Media contains 0.5% v/v 12C-glucose and no inositol (Heo and Son 2002)
	* Incubation temp: 30<sup>o</sup>C 
3. Autoclave media and 10 foil covered 1L flasks 
    * __Note:__ This recipe is for 1L of media, alter number of 1L flasks according to 
    the amount of media you need.
4. Add all of the filter-sterlized components of the media __EXCEPT__ for FeSO<sub>4</sub>
    * FeSO<sub>4</sub> will produce a precipitant, which is hard to aliquot to all 1L 
    flasks evenly
5. Aliquot 100 mL of media to each 1L flask
	* 1L flasks allows for a large liquid surface area for cellulose production
6. Add filter-sterlized FeSO<sub>4</sub> to each 1L flask.
7. Inoculate each aliquot of media with three isolated colonies of *Gluconoacetobacter
xylinus* from Heo and Son plate. 
8. Keep flasks static in the dark at 30<sup>o</sup>C for 2-3 weeks until thick cellulose 
pellicule forms. 
	* __WARNING:__ Any disturbance to the flasks may prevent/stop pellicule production


# Cellulose Harvest

1. Pour off excess culture from cellulose growth flask
2. Make 1% Alconox solution
3. Add Alconox 2:1 with cellulose+ residual media 
	* i.e., 200 mL of 1% alconox for every 100mL media culture
4. Autoclave for 30 minutes
5. Combine the pullicules into a large bucket/beaker
6. Rinse under high pressure DI water faucet 
	* ~10 times, or until no suds being produced
	* Use a screen to hold over beaker to pour out water each time. 
	* __Note:__ the pellicules should be clear/white in color. 
	Other coloring is probably due to contamination.
7. At end of rinsing, fill the bucket/beaker with DI H<sub>2</sub>O and cover. 
8. Let sit for 12 hours at room temp, then rinse 3 times under high pressure DI.
	* Use >= 1L water for each rinse.
9. Fill with water and let sit for another 12 hours. Repeat this for 2 days 
	* i.e., ~4 rinsings total
10. On the third day (after the 4<sup>th</sup> 12 hour soak):
	1. Rinse the cellulose another 3 times
	2. Decant all liquids and put only the cellulose on a pre-weighed weighboats
		* 1 weighboat per full-sized pellicule (this helps with drying)
11. Cover the weighboats with another weight to prevent contamination
(especially of streptomyces spores)
12. Place the weighboats in a drying oven overnight
13. Weigh dried pellicules and calculate difference (from weighboat)
	* Record the pellicule weight

# Media

## Hestrin and Schram 

* 2% glucose
* 0.5% peptone
* 0.5% yeast extract
* 0.27% Disodium phosphate anhydrous
* 0.115% Citric acid monohydrade
* 0.05% MgSO<sub>4</sub> x 7H<sub>2</sub>O
* 2% agar
* adjust the pH to ~6


## Heo and Son

* See HeoAndSonMinimalMedia.xls
* __NOTE:__ A precipitant will form shortly after adding the FeSO<sub>4</sub> 
    * The precipitant will look 'fluffy'

# Notes

* Yield from 13C-cellulose farming in 2014: __~24%__
