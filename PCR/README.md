# PCR

## Description
This directory contains protocols and scripts for amplifying DNA via PCR.

## Protocols:
* [PCR with barcoded primers:](./PCR_with_barcoded_primers.md)
	Describes how to set up and run PCR using barcoded primers for eventual sequencing with Illumina MiSeq. 


## Scripts:

## PCR recipes and thermocycler protocols:
* [Thermocycler Conditions for Illumina Miseq Barcoding:](./thermocycler-barcoding-protocol.md)
	Lists thermocycler conditions used to barcode samples for Illumina Miseq Sequencing.

## Primer lists and sequences:
* [Illumina primers:](./Illumina_primer_list.md)
	Barcoded primers with Illumina MiSeq adaptors used for sequencing.
