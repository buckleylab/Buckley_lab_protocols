# PCR

## Description
This directory contains protocols and scripts for amplifying DNA via PCR.

## Protocols:
### [PCR with barcoded primers](./PCR_with_barcoded_primers.md)
	Describes how to set up and run PCR using barcoded primers for eventual sequencing with Illumina MiSeq. 
### [Colony PCR with Sanger Seq.](./ColonyPCR_SangerSeq.md)
	Describes how to conduct PCR on bacterial colonies for Sanger sequencing.

## PCR recipes and thermocycler protocols
### [Thermocycler Conditions for Illumina Miseq Barcoding](./thermocycler-barcoding-protocol.md)
Lists thermocycler conditions used to barcode samples for Illumina Miseq Sequencing.

## Primer lists and sequences:
### [Illumina primers](./Illumina_primer_list.md)
Barcoded primers with Illumina MiSeq adaptors used for sequencing.
### [16S barcodes for demultiplexing](./16S_primer_barcodes_for_demultiplexing.xlsx)
Sequences used for demultiplexing raw data.
