Gel extraction protocol
=======================

## Authorship

Updated: Cassi Wattenburger 4/20/18 (increased amount of SybrSafe and gel dye to add, voltage)


## Printing this protocol

See **Printing protocols** in the [README](../README.md#printing-protocols-conversion-of-protocols-to-pdf)

## Notes

* The protocol uses the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega) with
some modifications


## Gel

* 1.5% low melt agarose gel with SybrSafe
* ~75V for 1-1.5 hrs (needs updating on time frame)


## Gel clean-up kit modifications

* __5.A., Step 3:__ flow melted gel through the column twice

* __5.A., Step 6:__ flow water through twice


## Method in detail

1. Use the speed-vac to evaporate the compiled pool of samples from each
Sequal plate purification to 100 uL (96 compiled samples per tube). 
	* The volumes can be divided among more tubed to decrease speed-vac time.

1. While speed-vac is running, prepare a 1.5% low melt (or normal) agarose gel, with
SybrSafe. 
	* Make 75 mL of agarose solution
		* Large volume needed to cast a gel with deep wells. 
	* 1.12 g of low melt agarose
	* 7.5 ul of SybrSafe

1. Add 20 uL of loading dye (6x concentration) to each concentrated 100 uL sample and mix well. 
	* Mix thoroughly

1. Load 50-55 uL of the sample into an individual well until all the sample is loaded. 
	* Use 7.5 ul of 100 bp ladder in the 1st lane (+1.5 ul of 6X loading dye).

1. Run the gel at ~75 volts for ~1.5 hours.
	* Lower voltage gives crisper bands, but takes much longer.

1. Pre-weight 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes (1 per sample).

1. Visualize the gel using the UV transilluminator in Room 712
	* (make sure to wear face shield!).
	* Cut out 400-600 bp bands from each lane. 
	
1. Put the cut bands into pre-weighted 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes and weight to find
final weight of gel.

1. Use the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System kit protocol to elute DNA
from gel slices. 
	* Protocol modifications include:
		* running binding solution (w. molten gel) through the column twice
			* increases binding of DNA to column
		* running eluted DNA through column twice in order 
			* increases DNA eluted off the column.
