# DNA Preparation for Sequencing

## Description
This directory contains protocols and other info for preparing DNA for sequencing.
Most of our sequencing is performed at the [Cornell Sequencing Center](http://www.biotech.cornell.edu/brc/genomics-facility) 

## Protocols:

### [Illumina MiSeq library preparation](./Illumina_MiSeq_library_preparation.md)
Post-PCR pipeline for sequencing a library consisting of barcoded DNA on Illumina's MiSeq technology.
 
### [Gel extraction protocol](./library_gel_extraction.md)
Running library on a gel and extracting DNA.
